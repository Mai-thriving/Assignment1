  <h1><p class="impact">2. Interest in IT </p></h1>

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

<div class="sans-serif">
    <p>My interest in IT was ignited first when I realize that nowadays, many giant corporations are technology-based and most of the successful and young companies today are digital startups. Moreover, this industry does not require as intensive capital investment as others, such as manufacturing or transportation, and there is still a lot of space in this sector for those ambitious youngsters like me to thrive.
    <br>Until recently, after joining a session about Digital Business hosted by RMIT Career Mentoring, I was inspired by the words of Mr. John Masud Parvez that actually, the growth of technology in generally, has helped us with easy tasks and left us with more difficult jobs that crave for human intervention. Being impressed by this sharing, I have realized the magnitude of acquiring IT knowledge and apply it to my future career, which then leads me to the decision of choosing the course of Introduction to IT of RMIT Vietnam to ameliorate my IT proficiency. Furthermore, digital innovation has raised though-provoking questions in me about how it can alter the way people interact with each other (and even with the machines) and how the society will develop in the future. Will there be any chance that robots can live and work harmonically with humans? Should we, the human beings, be dramatically worried about the massive improvement of technology?
    <br>RMIT becomes the destination of my choice due to its up-to-date infrastructure, and also because most of the alumni of RMIT have been seen to earn successful achievement after graduating, which has left a profound impression of the quality of this school on me.
    <br>During my learning journey at RMIT, I hope to be encountered with realistic and practical experiences which can be gained from the learning materials provided by the school, from the assistance of the lecturers and my mates, as well as the participation in other extracurricular activities.
